# SNAPI

This is a server for a social network that allows one to create users, add thoughts and associated reactions, as well as link users as friends.<br><br>

Usage: once deployed, locally or remotely, the home url (GET http://localhost:3001/ if deployed locally) returns a list of valid api calls with the required parameters and bodies.<br>
This program can be deployed with no modifications to Heroku for the server and Mongo Atlas for the database. 


Please find the a demonstration video with first 11 api calls here: <a href="https://watch.screencastify.com/v/nXs2iulKTi9l2EGHmxZD">Demo Video 1</a><br>
